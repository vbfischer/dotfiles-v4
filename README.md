# My Dotfiles

## Install

Directory structure is such that it allows easy deploy using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

```
stow zshrc
stow kitty
stow tmux
stow nvim
```

## nvim-new

This is an experimental rebuild of my `nvim` configuration.
Currently, if added via `stow nvim-new` then can be run by
calling `nnvim`
